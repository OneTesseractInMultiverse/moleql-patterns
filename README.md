# MoleQL Patterns

Reusable base classes and design patterns for clean, decoupled application architecture.

**moleql-patterns** is a lightweight Python library built on **Pydantic** and inspired by **FastAPI**.
It provides small, composable abstractions intended to standardize common application behaviors
without introducing framework lock-in.

This project is designed to be used as *infrastructure*: explicit, predictable, and easy to reason about.
